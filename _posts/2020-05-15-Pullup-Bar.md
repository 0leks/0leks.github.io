This was initially going to be a pullup bar plus climbing wall combo. In the plans I had a plywood sheet attached to the non-bar half which would have some climbing holds attached. I decided to start off by making the basic pullup bar setup with no climbing wall attachment.

Upon completing the only-bar construction, I realized that it would take up too much space in the living room so I scrapped the climbing wall idea and stripped the design down to just a bar. The plan is to have the bar and its supports standing vertically in the doorway with some wooden clamps to keep it from tipping over. The wall in between the living room and kitchen is only about 4 inches thick and with a clamp on either side it should be able to keep the bar from tipping under a person's weight.
